# Race Shares 

Periodically, the Census Bureau produces projections of the population by sex, age, race, and origin.
Here I am interested in calculating what those projections imply for the share of the population that is white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and other now and into the future. Furthermore, I am interested in seeing how much those implied shares in Census' most recent projections have changed since it previous projection.
