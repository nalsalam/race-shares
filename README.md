# Race Shares (v 2.0)

Periodically, the Census Bureau produces projections of the population by sex, age, race, and origin.

Here I am interested in calculating what those projections imply for the share of the population that is White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Asian and Other recently and into the future. 

The Census Bureau population projections in 2014, 2017, and 2023. The shiny app shows that the projected race-origin shares did not change across these releases.
